It is a single page HTML app, using _React_ and node module _dots-and-boxes_.
The game board is based on CSS grid layout.
A ready to use app is in _build_ folder.

## Review
_Create React App_ is a verry usefull base to create web apps. It made a lof of fun to work with.
EsLint and WebPack are already installed and configured.
JSX is very handy, although sometimes a bit getting used to, it's a litle bit like PHP.
The build is slightly overstated with 1.6MB, but the development time was very short.
